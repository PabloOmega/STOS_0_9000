# STOS_0_9000

In this project, I demonstrate how to use the lvgl library with a screen connected through FMC parallel connection. To accomplish this, I utilize an STM32H743 Discovery Board with FreeRTOS to manage the screen and USB HID Keyboard. The screen displays a background and a text area that is connected to the keyboard, allowing the user to enter text.
